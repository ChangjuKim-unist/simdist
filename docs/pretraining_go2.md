### Expert Policy Training

To train, use the below, replacing `<wandb_username>` with your Weights and Biases username (if you don't have an account, create one at [https://wandb.ai/](https://wandb.ai/)). Runs are saved to `checkpoints/rl/`. The environment config is found in [`simdist/rl/go2.py`](simdist/rl/go2.py) and the PPO config is found in [`simdist/rl/rsl_rl_ppo_cfg.py`](simdist/rl/rsl_rl_ppo_cfg.py).

```bash
WANDB_USERNAME=<wandb_username> python scripts/train_rl.py --task Go2 --headless
```

To visualize and play an expert policy, use the below, replacing `<run_folder_name>` with the name of the folder from training that is found in `checkpoints/rl/` (for example: `2025-03-14_05-14-42`).

```bash
python scripts/play_rl.py --task Go2Play --num_envs 32 -r <run_folder_name> --real-time
```

After rl training, export the policies and value functions with the below, replacing `<run_folder_name>` with the name of the folder from training that is found in `checkpoints/rl/` (for example: `2025-03-14_05-14-42`).

```bash
python scripts/export_policies.py -r <run_folder_name>
```

### Data Generation

Generate data with the below, replacing `<run_folder_name>` with the name of the folder from training that is found in `checkpoints/rl/` (for example: `2025-03-14_05-14-42`). This will save data to `datasets/sim/`. The configuration for data generation is found in [`config/generate_data.yaml`](config/generate_data.yaml).

```bash
python scripts/generate_data.py rl_run=<run_folder_name>
```

Next, post-process the data with the below, replacing `<dataset_name>` with the name of the dataset in `datasets/sim/`. This script concatenates all of the episodes into single dataset files and computes parameters for input/output scaling. The configuration for data processing is found in [`config/process_data.yaml`](config/process_data.yaml). The processed dataset is saved to `datasets/sim/<dataset_name>/processed_data_{system}_{pred_len}_{hist_len}`.

```bash
python scripts/process_data.py dataset_name=<dataset_name>
```

### World Model Pretraining

Pretrain the world model with the below, replacing `<dataset_name>` with the name of the dataset in `datasets/sim/`. Checkpoints will be saved in `checkpoints/models/`; use `<run_name>` to specify the name of the checkpoints (optional). Optionally, launch with `wandb.log=true` and `wandb.entity=<your_wandb_entity_or_username>` to enable Weights and Biases logging. Additional configuration is found in [`config/train_model.yaml`](config/train_model.yaml).

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py data.dataset_name=<dataset_name> run_name=<run_name>
```

### Deployment (Simulation)

Deploy, in simulation, the pretrained world model using sampling-based planning with the below, replacing `<checkpoint_name>` with the name of the checkpoint in `checkpoints/models/`. Use `--headless` to run without a GUI. Additional configuration is found in [`config/simulate_go2.yaml`](config/simulate_go2.yaml).

```bash
python scripts/simulate_go2.py model.checkpoint=<checkpoint_name>
```
### Unitree Go1

The pipeline above can also be run for the Unitree Go1. The Go1 shares the Go2's joint layout, so only the robot asset, base body name, and motor limits differ (see [`simdist/rl/go1.py`](../simdist/rl/go1.py)). Use the `Go1`/`Go1Play` tasks for the RL scripts and `system=go1` for the data and model scripts:

```bash
python scripts/train_rl.py --task Go1 --headless
python scripts/play_rl.py --task Go1Play --num_envs 32 -r <run_folder_name> --real-time
python scripts/export_policies.py --task Go1Play -r <run_folder_name>
python scripts/generate_data.py rl_run=<run_folder_name> system=go1
python scripts/process_data.py dataset_name=<dataset_name> system=go1
python scripts/train_model.py data.dataset_name=<dataset_name> system=go1 run_name=<run_name>
python scripts/simulate_go2.py model.checkpoint=<checkpoint_name>
```

`simulate_go2.py` picks the Go1 or Go2 simulation environment from the system recorded in the model checkpoint, so it needs no extra flag.
